# Engage Elementor Form Action

The Engage Elementor Form Action lets you use Engage as a form action in your Elementor forms. This is useful for creating lead forms that add leads to your Engage account. You can then use Automations to create messaging workflow to convert the leads.

Form submissions are added as new subscribers to a List on your Engage account. You will therefore need a List the form submission will be sent to. You can create a new List (Customers -> Lists -> Create a new List) or use an existing List. 

You can map your form fields to the following standard attributes:
- First name
- Last name
- Email
- Phone number

Every other form field will be added to Engage as an additional custom user attribute. (You can view all custom attributes via Customers -> Attributes). Email or Phone number must mapped and filled for the submission to be accepted.
